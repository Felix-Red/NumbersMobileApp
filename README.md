# Numbers - Mobile App
This repository contains the mobile version of an app I originally created for my grandfather to suggest random numbers according to the lottery intervals he prefers.

# Background
I initially developed a desktop application called "Numbers" using C#, which randomly generates lottery numbers for my grandfather. The desktop app worked well, but there was one major inconvenience: each time my grandfather asked for numbers, I had to grab my laptop, power it on, and then generate the numbers. This process created unnecessary friction.

To solve this issue, I decided to develop a mobile app that would make it easier to quickly generate lottery numbers. The mobile app allows me to have the numbers ready for my grandfather at the tip of my fingers, removing the need for the desktop setup.

# Features
Random lottery number generation based on specified intervals.
Quick and easy access to the numbers anytime, anywhere.

# Technology Stack
Kotlin for mobile app development.
Csharp for the original desktop application.
